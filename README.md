# MultipleSectionsCollectionView
Multiple Sections CollectionView demo.

This is a model that can be used for many different types of applications.
The application I had in mind is for a toddler/child app. 
The redViewController I added a button that reveals the dismiss button(otherwise it is hidden and disabled), this is more suited for an applicable something like a drawing app where you would want to give the user more room to draw and not have to much on UI.
